  "faq_question5": "5. How can I register to use the app's advanced information and services?",
  "faq_answer1": "The following points will help you to identify the right replacement part:\nAre there any signatures (Schüco lettering or the crown) on the product?\n\nWhich kind of opening unit is it? Is it a window/balcony door or an entrance door?\n\nWhat material is the opening unit made of? Aluminium or PVC-U?\n\nWhich product do you need a replacement part for?\n   a) Do you know the article number of the defective component (if unknown, perhaps one of the other components in the opening unit)?\n   b) Do you know the profile system/series? ,, You will find more information on this on your purchase invoice.\n   c) Do you know the year* that the opening unit’s construction was built? Your purchase invoice may help you further here too.\n   d) Do you know the basic depth (in mm) of the fixed frame?",
  "faq_answer2": "The fittings in a window connect the moving part of a window (the vent) with the fixed part (the frame). Depending on the opening type of the window, there are different fittings types, such as side-hung and turn/tilt, tilt-before-turn fittings or shutter fittings. With side-hung fittings, using the handle will move the window from the closed position to the turn position. Turn/tilt fittings move the window first into the turn position and then into the tilt position. Tilt-before-turn window handles are the reverse of the general functions of a turn/tilt fitting (90° tilt / 180° turn). Windows with window shutters have shutter fittings.",
  "faq_answer3": "Windows/balcony doors: If the handle is on the right-hand side, it is a DIN left window/balcony door (opening to the left). If the handle is on the left-hand side, the window/balcony door is DIN right (opening to the right).\n\nEntrance door: If the door handle is on the right-hand side, it is a DIN left door (opening to the left). If the door handle is on the left-hand side, the entrance door is DIN right (opening to the right).",
  "faq_answer4": "If article numbers can be seen on the visible parts of the lock, please share these with us. There may also be stickers, engravings etc. on the inside of the lock (or lock case) which may point to article numbers. Otherwise the dimensions of a lock are required for identification.",
  "faq_answer5": "In order to use the extended information and services of the app, a Schüco customer number and a Schüco-Connect user is required.
